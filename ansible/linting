101: Deprecated always_run
  Instead of ``always_run``, use ``check_mode``
102: No Jinja2 in when
  ``when`` lines should not include Jinja2 variables
103: Deprecated sudo
  Instead of ``sudo``/``sudo_user``, use ``become``/``become_user``.
104: Using bare variables is deprecated
  Using bare variables is deprecated. Update your playbooks so that the environment value uses the full variable syntax ``{{ your_variable }}``
105: Deprecated module
  These are deprecated modules, some modules are kept temporarily for backwards compatibility but usage is discouraged. For more details see: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/list_of_all_modules.html
201: Trailing whitespace
  There should not be any trailing whitespace
202: Octal file permissions must contain leading zero or be a string
  Numeric file permissions without leading zero can behave in unexpected ways. See http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/file_module.html
203: Most files should not contain tabs
  Tabs can cause unexpected display issues, use spaces
204: Lines should be no longer than 160 chars
  Long lines make code harder to read and code review more difficult
205: Use ".yml" or ".yaml" playbook extension
  Playbooks should have the ".yml" or ".yaml" extension
206: Variables should have spaces before and after: {{ var_name }}
  Variables should have spaces before and after: ``{{ var_name }}``
301: Commands should not change things if nothing needs doing
  Commands should either read information (and thus set ``changed_when``) or not do something if it has already been done (using creates/removes) or only do it if another check has a particular result (``when``)
302: Using command rather than an argument to e.g. file
  Executing a command when there are arguments to modules is generally a bad idea
303: Using command rather than module
  Executing a command when there is an Ansible module is generally a bad idea
304: Environment variables don't work as part of command
  Environment variables should be passed to ``shell`` or ``command`` through environment argument
305: Use shell only when shell functionality is required
  Shell should only be used when piping, redirecting or chaining commands (and Ansible would be preferred for some of those!)
306: Shells that use pipes should set the pipefail option
  Without the pipefail option set, a shell command that implements a pipeline can fail and still return 0. If any part of the pipeline other than the terminal command fails, the whole pipeline will still return 0, which may be considered a success by Ansible. Pipefail is available in the bash shell.
401: Git checkouts must contain explicit version
  All version control checkouts must point to an explicit commit or tag, not just ``latest``
402: Mercurial checkouts must contain explicit revision
  All version control checkouts must point to an explicit commit or tag, not just ``latest``
403: Package installs should not use latest
  Package installs should use ``state=present`` with or without a version
404: Doesn't need a relative path in role
  ``copy`` and ``template`` do not need to use relative path for ``src``
501: become_user requires become to work as expected
  ``become_user`` without ``become`` will not actually change user
502: All tasks should be named
  All tasks should have a distinct name for readability and for ``--start-at-task`` to work
503: Tasks that run when changed should likely be handlers
  If a task has a ``when: result.changed`` setting, it is effectively acting as a handler
504: Do not use 'local_action', use 'delegate_to: localhost'
  Do not use ``local_action``, use ``delegate_to: localhost``
601: Don't compare to literal True/False
  Use ``when: var`` rather than ``when: var == True`` (or conversely ``when: not var``)
602: Don't compare to empty string
  Use ``when: var`` rather than ``when: var != ""`` (or conversely ``when: not var`` rather than ``when: var == ""``)
701: meta/main.yml should contain relevant info
  meta/main.yml should contain: ``author, description, license, min_ansible_version, platforms``
702: Tags must contain lowercase letters and digits only
  Tags must contain lowercase letters and digits only, and ``galaxy_tags`` is expected to be a list
703: meta/main.yml default values should be changed
  meta/main.yml default values should be changed for: ``author, description, company, license, license``
704: meta/main.yml video_links should be formatted correctly
  Items in ``video_links`` in meta/main.yml should be dictionaries, and contain only keys ``url`` and ``title``, and have a shared link from a supported provider
